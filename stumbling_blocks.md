# Stumbling Blocks
## Major stumbling blocks in learning Haskell
> __*By Vincent Jodjana*__

So far as of right now, one of the major stumbling blocks I have had in
learning Haskell is the syntax. The syntax really threw me off because it
was so simplistic yet different compared to some of the previous programming
languages I had learned.

For example, I was really confused with setting up functions in Haskell. It
was really weird to me that you didn't like def in Python or public static void
main() { } in Java.

    function ... = ...           def function:          public static void main() {
    function ... = ...              ...                     ...
                                    return x                return x;
                                                        }

One thing that helped me overcome this obstacle was to really think of it like
mathematical equations. That mindset really put a lot of the concepts back
together thanks to my friend [Dan] (https://danshaub.github.io/).
