## Personal preferences on what helped me learn Haskell
> __*By Vincent Jodjana*__

You know what everyone says. Dr. Google is your best friend. However, for me it
was not the best method to learn and understand it. In fact, it actually took a
while before I began to understand the basic gists of it, especially when it came
to writing functions and thinking logically in Haskell.

I would say the biggest contribution to a better overall understanding was talking
with my friends and classmates in my CPSC 353 class and working on it together.
When I was going through the homework and assignments in my class, I would call or
text classmates when I got super stuck and didn't seem to understand anything despite
looking up things online. Interestingly, it was through a classmate telling me to think
of Haskell and the assignments as applied Discrete Mathematics was where things began to
click in a sense.

Of course I understand that sites such as stack exchange and videos on youtube definitely
can help other people better, so I am not denying that. This is what personally helped me
understand Haskell and functional programming languages much better.
