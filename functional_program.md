For many people who have started their degree in computer science of learned programming at all, what programing
languages did you end up starting with? Personally, I started with C++ while other have started learning Python or
Java. **What do these languages have in common?**

They are imperative programming languages. Never heard of it? Taking Programming Languages (CPSC 354) at Chapman was the first time I had heard about imperative and functional programming languages.
