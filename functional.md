# An Understanding of Functional Programming
## A blog describing what is functional programming
> __*By Vincent Jodjana*__

What was your first language when you first learned to code? Mine was C++. Some people started with Python. Others with Java. What do those languages have in common? Well, they are known as imperative programming languages. When I took a class called Programming Languages or CPSC 354 in my senior year at Chapman, I learned about a functional programming language called Haskell.

So what is a functional programming language? Well, they are essentially programming languages that are constructed by applying and composing functions, hence the name functional. The functional definitions in functional languages are trees of expressions that each return a value. This is different from imperative languages in that imperative programming languages can use instructional statements that can change the state of a program. For more information regarding the difference between functional programming and imperative programming, you can check the blog on [comparing imperative and functional programming languages](https://github.com/vcjod00/HaskellTutorial/blob/main/comparison.md).

Interestingly, functional programming has roots in academics, coming from concepts of lambda calculus which is a formal system of computation based on functions. Lambda calculus was developed by a man named Alonzo Church, who discovered his theory on lambda calculus and the Turing machines invented by Alan Turing are equivalent models of computation. Turing machines are mathematical models of computation that defines abstract machines. They manipulate symbols on strips of tapes according to a tabel of rules. The amazing thing about the Turing Machine is any computer algorithm is capable of being simulated by it. Church proved in 1937 that lambda calculus is Turing complete and would be the foundation of the functional programming languages we see today.

The first ever functional programming language was known as LISP. LISP functions were defined utilizing lambda notation. It also included a label construct that would allow recursive functions to work. LISP is also an example of a specified type of functional programming language known as impure functional languages. Haskell would be an example of a pure functional language. The difference between the two is pure functional languages support only the functional paradigms whereas impure support both functional paradigms and imperative style programming.

There are some pretty important concepts to know in regards to functional programming languages. Many of them are foreign and not used in imperative programming languages. Here are the most noticeable concepts.
1. First Class and higher order functions
2. Pure Functions
3. Recursion
4. Strict and Nonstrict Evaluation
5. Type Systems
6. Referential Transparency
7. Data Structures

# First Class and Higher Order Functions
Higher order functions are functions that take functions as arguments or return functions as results. An example related to Calculus would look something like this.

![Higher Order Derivatives](https://www.shelovesmath.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Higher-Order-Derivatives.png)

In addition, higher order functions enable currying, which is a technique that applies functions to its arguments one at a time. Each application would then return a new function that accepts the next argument. An example would look something like 1 is defined to be S(O), and the addition on natural numbers looks like 

    m + O = m
    m + S(n) = S(m + n)

This is a successor function that could compute the addition of two natural numbers. For example, 1 + 2 = 1 + S(1) = S(1 + 1) + S(1 + S(O)) = S(S(1 + 0)) = S(S(1)) = S(2) = 3

First class are similar to higher order functions, but first class is a computer science term for programming language entities that do not have restrictions on their use.

# Pure Functions
Pure functions are functions that have no memory or input/output. They have several useful properties which optimize the code:

1. If the result of a pure function isn't used, then it can be removed without affecting other expressions.
2. Referential Trasparency: The idea that if a pure function is called with arguments that have no memory or I/O, the result is constant with respect to that argument list. 
3. If there is no data dependency between two pure expressions, their order can be reversed. In other words, the evaluation of any pure expression is thread-safe.
4. If the entire language does not allow side-effects, then any evaluation strategy can be used. This allows the compiler to reorder or combine the evaluation of expressions in a program. 

# Recursion
Unlike typical imperative programming languages such as Java and Python, you can iterate using loops. For functional languages, it is typically accomplished using recursion. Through recursion, recursive functions will invoke themselves and allow an operation to repeat until it reaches the base case.

Many general purpose functional programming languages allow unrestricted recursion and are Turing complete. This could make the problem of determining whether a program will finish running or continue on forever undecided. It could also cause unsoundness of equational reasoning and could require the introduction of inconsistency. 

# Strict and Nonstrict Evaluation
Functional languages can be categorized into strict and nonstrict evaluation. These concepts refer to how function arguments are processed when an expression is being evaluated. The technical difference between strict and nonstrict evaluation is when there is a failing computation in the expression. For example:

    print length([5+2, 2*3, 2/0, 7-4])

This expression would fail under strict evaluation because dividing by zero is a failed computation. On the other hand, if it was a nonstrict evaluation, it would run and return the value 4. Strict evaluation always fully evaluates function arguments before it invokes the function whereas nonstrict evaluation don't unless their values are required to evaluate the function itself. 

# Type Systems
Functional languages tend to use typed lambda calculus. This rejects all invalid programs at compilation time and risk false positive errors. The use of algebraic data types makes the manipulation of complex data structures convenient , and the presence of strong compile-time checking makes their programs more reliable.

There are some research-oriented functional languages like Cayenne and Epigram that are based on intuinistic type theory, allowing types to depend on terms. They are also known as dependent types. They can express arbitrary propositions in predicate logic or first-order logic. These are pretty difficult to understand and program, but they are mainly of interest in academic research.

# Referential Trasparency
Unlike imperative languages, functional languages do not have assignment statements. In imperative languages, one can change the value of a variable once defined. This will help remove any chance of side effects because any variable can be replaced with its actual value at the point of execution. Thus, functional langauges are considered to be referentially transparent.

# Data Structures
Purely functional data structures are represented differently than imperative data structures. They have persistence, which is a property of keeping previous versions of the data structures unmodified. For example, calling the insert function in trees using persistence will result in some but not all nodes being created.

# So.... how do newcomers learn functional programming languages?
If you already have experience in programming in imperative languages like Java or Python, functional languages are going to come off a bit different and wack at first. One thing to really keep in mind is to treat a function as like a math equation or taking different cases like in discrete mathematics. This mentality will help you shape how to write out your functions in a functional language like Haskell. Of course, watching videos on youtube or taking tutorials online will also help you learn as well.
