What is Haskell? The first time I had ever heard of a language came from my CPSC 354 class during my
senior year at Chapman University. Up until then I had no idea of what a functional programming language
was.

Haskell first appeared in the 1930s and was named after a mathematician named Haskell Curry. 

Haskell is a type of functional programming language. When I first started taking computer programming 
classes as a computer science major, the first language I had ever learned was C++. The many programming
languages that many people are familiar include C++, Python, and Java. What do these languages have in 
common? They are imperative programming languages? 

A difference between functional and imperative languages is functional programming is stateless. Instead
of assigning values which can be changed in imperative languages, the returned value is dependent on the
input. In addition, functional programming languages use recursion instead of for and while loops.
