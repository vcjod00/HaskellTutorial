What is Haskell? The first time I had ever heard of a language came from my CPSC 354 class during my
senior year at Chapman University. Up until then I had no idea of what a functional programming language
was much less Haskell.

Haskell first appeared in the 1990s and was named after a mathematician named Haskell Curry.

# History
Haskell and its semantics were historically based off of the Miranda programming language. Miranda is a type of non-strict purely functional programming language, meaning it lacks imperative programming features. At a conference on Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture, there was a discussion to consolidate existing functional languages into a common one to serve as a basis for future research in functional-language design. The first version of Haskell, Haskell 1.0, was defined in 1990. This version of Haskell included Type classes, which enable type-safe operator overloading.
