## Personal preferences on what helped me learn Haskell
> __*By Vincent Jodjana*__

You know what everyone says. [Dr. Google](https://www.google.com/) is your best 
friend. However, for me it was not the best method to learn and understand it.
In fact, it actually took a while before I began to understand the basic gists
of it, especially when it came to writing functions and thinking logically in 
Haskell.

I would say the biggest contribution to a better overall understanding was talking
with my friends and classmates in my CPSC 353 class and working on it together.
When I was going through the homework and assignments in my class, I would call or
text classmates when I got super stuck and didn't seem to understand anything despite
looking up things online. Interestingly, it was through a classmate telling me to think
of Haskell and the assignments as applied Discrete Mathematics was where things began to
click in a sense.

Of course, there are definitely some links I can reference that I personally think would
help many people understand Haskell and its fundamentals.

These were the introduction during the first week of my CPSC 353 class

[Imperative vs Functional Programming](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJKWvna6U)

[Haskell: Recursion in Functional Programming](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/H1jUka4Gv)

These were tutorials outside of class but referenced from the previous links

[Haskell in Five Steps](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_5_steps)

[Haskell in 10 Minutes](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learn_Haskell_in_10_minutes)

and these were tutorials outside of class as a whole

recently, I had discovered these links which have been lately extremely useful as well to understanding the basics of Haskell.
