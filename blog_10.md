# Stumbling Blocks
## Major stumbling blocks in learning Haskell
> __*By Vincent Jodjana*__

So far as of right now, one of the major stumbling blocks I have had in
learning Haskell is the syntax. The syntax really threw me off because it
was so simplistic yet different compared to some of the previous programming
languages I had learned.

For example, I was really confused with setting up functions in Haskell. It
was really weird to me that you didn't like def in Python or public static void
main() { } in Java.

    function ... = ...           def function:          public static void main() {
    function ... = ...              ...                     ...
                                    return x                return x;
                                                        }

One thing that helped me overcome this obstacle was to really think of it like
mathematical equations. That mindset really put a lot of the concepts back
together thanks to my friend [Dan Haub](https://danshaub.github.io/).

This leads to what really helped me a lot with overcoming the difficulties and
obstacles of learning Haskell which was discussing with classmates. Group discussion
I feel are an underrated yet much appreciated solution to understanding and learning
a new language like Haskell.

The site that helped me the most understand to syntax and the fundamentals of Haskell are on this page

[Haskell in Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell)

Assignments from Programming Languages and seeking help from friends also further increased my knowledge of Haskell.
